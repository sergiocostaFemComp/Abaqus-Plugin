# UniDam: An Abaqus Plugin for Calibration and Validation of a Damage Model for Composites

## Overview
UniDam is a robust Abaqus plugin designed to facilitate the usage of a state-of-the-art damage model for composite materials. Developed to support researchers and engineers working with composite structures, UniDam aims to streamline the processes of model calibration, verification, and visualization.

## Features
- **Model Calibration**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for calibrating damage models for composite materials.
- **Single-Element Tests**: Allows users to create and execute single-element tests necessary for model verification.
- **Stress-Strain Visualization**: Generates and displays stress-strain curves, aiding in the validation and understanding of the model.
- **Error Reduction**: Reduces the likelihood of user errors during calibration and verification, making advanced damage models more accessible to a wider audience.

## Installation
To install UniDam, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have Abaqus installed on your system.
2. Download the UniDam plugin from this repository.
3. Copy the folder to your Abaqus instalation plugin folder. In my case the python files are located in: C:\SIMULIA\EstProducts\2021\win_b64\code\python2.7\lib\abaqus_plugins\UniDamComp

## Usage
1. Launch Abaqus and load the UniDam plugin.
2. Use the provided interface to configure the model parameters and initiate calibration.
3. Perform single-element tests and view the resulting stress-strain curves for model verification.

## Requirements
- **Abaqus**: Version 6.14 or higher.
- **Python**: Version 2.7 (compatible with Abaqus scripting).
